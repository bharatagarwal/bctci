# Viewer Counter Class

Streamers make money based on the number of views they receive while streaming. Implement a ViewerCounter class that tracks the number of viewers within a configurable time window for a live stream event. Viewer types may be "guest", "follower", or "subscriber".

Track number of viewers within a time window

- guest
- follower
- subscriber

ViewerCounter:
	- init(window): establishes a window size â‰¥ 1
	- join(t, v): registers that a viewer of type v joined at time t
	- get_viewers(t, v): gets the viewer count of viewer type v within the time window of length 'window' ending at timestamp t: [t - window, t], with both endpoints included.

- initialise with window size
- join as a viewer of type v at time t
- get viewers of type v, within time window
	- falling in range (t-window, t)


order of joining matters
- three stacks, for guest, follower, subscriber

Both methods accept a timestamp t represented by an integer.

It is guaranteed that each method call receives a time that is greater than or equal to any timestamp used in previous calls to either join() or get_viewers().


Constraints:
	- The number of join and get_viewers operations is at most 10^5
	- 1 <= window <= 10^5
